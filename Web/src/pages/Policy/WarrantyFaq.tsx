          <h2>Limited Hardware Warranty</h2>
          <p>
            WIZMAX provides a non-transferable warranty to the original
            purchaser of WIZMAX product purchased from an authorized WIZMAX
            dealer and reseller. WIZMAX warrants that the product shall be free
            from defects in material and workmanship for a specified period
            starting on the date of purchase. The warranty period will vary by
            specific product which can be identified in the user documentation,
            on the product package, or in WIZMAX Warranty Periods list provided.
            If the warranty periods specified in these sources vary, the longest
            duration will apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except where prohibited by applicable local law, this warranty is
            limited to the original purchaser and is non-transferable. To avail
            of warranty benefits, a valid proof of purchase must be presented.
            This warranty provides you with specific legal rights, and you may
            have additional rights that vary under local laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, the warranty assures that the WIZMAX product will
            function as per the published technical specifications in the
            datasheet and within its intended operating environment for the
            length of the warranty period.

          <h2>Remedies</h2>
          <p>
            WIZMAX’s entire liability and the original purchaser’s exclusive
            remedy for any WIZMAX product that is not operating in accordance
            with its published technical specifications is at WIZMAX’s
            discretion, repair or replace the product at WIZMAX’s expense,
            provided that the product is returned to the point of purchase or
            such other place as WIZMAX may direct with a copy of the sales
            receipt or dated itemized receipt. Except where prohibited by
            applicable law, the original purchases may be required to pay
            shipping and handling charges, as well as any applicable tariffs,
            duties, taxes, or other fees. Insure and/or bear the risk of damage
            in transit, when the returned product received by WIZMAX, shall be
            well packed, in good condition, and the accessories are complete,
            otherwise WIZMAX shall be entitled to refuse acceptance. Unless laws
            provide otherwise, WIZMAX may provide refurbished products or use
            refurbished parts for repair. The replaced parts or products will
            become WIZMAX’s property. Unless the local laws provided otherwise,
            any replacement hardware product or parts will be warranted for the
            remainder of the original warranty period or{" "}

          <h2>Obsolete or Discontinued Products</h2>
          <p>
            If a WIZMAX product is no longer available or has been discontinued,
            WIZMAX will replace it with the same product if possible. However,
            if the same product is not available, WIZMAX will replace it with a
            product that has similar function and capacity, at its sole
            discretion. WIZMAX may also replace an obsolete or discontinued
            product with replacement models that have equivalent functions
            within the current product series, or products of the same brand
            that offer the same or better performance than the original product.

            WIZMAX reserves the right to provide any other type of remedial

          <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            If a user suffers losses due to WIZMAX&#39;s negligence, the user
            may request compensation from WIZMAX. However, regardless of the
            reason for the user&#39;s compensation request (including but not
            limited to fundamental breach of contract, negligence,
            misrepresentation, or other contractual obligation or tort),
            WIZMAX&#39;s liability shall be limited to the actual direct loss
            suffered by the user, up to the amount of the price paid by the user
            for the product. This limitation also applies to the maximum amount
            of responsibility shared by WIZMAX&#39;s dealers and resellers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Under no circumstances shall WIZMAX, its dealers, or resellers be
            liable for the following situations: 1) objections or compensation
            requests raised by third parties; 2) loss or damage to the
            user&#39;s records or data; 3) losses caused by the user&#39;s
            failure to retrieve the product in a timely manner.
          </p>

          <p>
            WIZMAX shall not be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or
            consequential damages whatsoever, including but not limited to loss
            of profits, revenue, or data (whether direct or indirect), or
            commercial loss, resulting from the breach of any express or implied
            warranty on the user&#39;s product, even if WIZMAX has been advised
            previously of the possibility of such damages. It should be noted
            that some local laws do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
            special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, so this
            limitation or exclusion may not apply in certain jurisdictions.

            Prior to returning the Product or receiving technical assistance

            responsibility to complete a backup of all existing data, software,

            data loss. WIZMAX shall have no liability for the loss of data,

          <p>
            If you bought a WIZMAX product from a different seller, it might be
            more efficient to resolve any warranty issues by contacting the
            original seller. Since the return policy and warranty period may
            differ based on the retailer, it&#39;s advisable to check their
            policies before proceeding. Alternatively, you can choose to have
            WIZMAX handle your warranty claim.

            To exercise your warranty rights, you are required to present a

            It is important to note that when making a limited warranty claim
            with WIZMAX, a valid proof of purchase is required. In order to be
            considered valid by WIZMAX, this proof of purchase must meet one of

            It is crucial to understand that any other forms of proof of

            asking for additional verification of the claimant&#39;s identity,
            information regarding qualifying purchases, and the possibility of
            disqualifying the claim.

          <h2>Why does WIZMAX require a valid proof of purchase?</h2>
          <p>
            At WIZMAX, it is imperative that we achieve a complete verification
            whether the product falls within the applicable limited warranty
            period, and that it was purchased from an authorized WIZMAX products
            seller.
          </p>

          <p>
            Products that are purchased from unauthorized sellers can often be
            counterfeit, repackaged, defective, or gray market products sold
            without the manufacturer&#39;s permission. These items may also not
            have been designed and packaged for the purchaser&#39;s country and
            may not meet all legal and safety requirements. WIZMAX cannot accept
            limited warranty claims for products that were not purchased from an
            authorized dealer, or for products whose limited warranty period has
            expired. If a product is purchased from an unauthorized dealer, all
            support and limited warranty issues should be directed to that said
            dealer.
          </p>
          <p>
            WIZMAX has implemented these policies designed to serve as
            protective measures for the benefit and safeguarding of both our
            valued customers and authorized resellers.

          <h2>What if I don’t have a proof of purchase?</h2>
          <p>
            If the customer does not have a valid proof of purchase, there are
            several options available to them.
          </p>

          <p>
            If they purchased from an authorized WIZMAX dealer or reseller, they
            can contact the dealer or reseller to obtain a copy of their
            receipt. Dealers and resellers usually have a purchase history on
            file and can provide a copy of the receipt to the customer.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the product was purchased online, the customer should check their
            e-mail for a confirmation page indicating that the product has been
            shipped.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the product was received as a gift, the customer should ask the
            gift giver for a receipt. If the customer is having difficulty
            obtaining a receipt as it can be inappropriate, they can ask the
            gift giver to handle the limited warranty process on their behalf.
